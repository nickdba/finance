# Real estate

The real estate investing is an interesting thing. As it can be done in many ways.

* Buying your own house.
* Buying houses or commercial property to rent.
* Invest into an reit.
* Buying stocks of a company that develops houses.

Although all these types of investments are different, they are all affected by the movement of property market.
So make sure that you do not invest all your savings in the same market segment.
