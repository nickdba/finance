# Bonds

Bonds have a bad rep and I tend to agree. I don't find them way less riskier than equities.  
Even governments do default on their debt a lot and if even when they do not, they may be happy to leave inflation run rampart.  
Given that the return is also not great. I wouldn't bother with them unless there is nothing else better to invest into.
